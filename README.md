# Objective:
- DivvyBikes_2022 project aims at analysisng the customer or the bike's user behaviour to help the business strategy department assess the current logistics model of bike distribution across the city and identify expansion opportunities.
- The project’s objective is to conduct a descriptive analysis of existing data and discover actionable insights for the business strategy team to help make informed decisions that will circumvent availability issues and ensure the company’s position as a leader in eco-friendly transportation solutions in the city.

# Data and Tools used:
- For this project, I used open source data from the Citi Bike database for the year 2022.
- To enrich this data set, I gathered weather data using NOAA’s API service and merged these 2 datasets to to gain the valuable resources for predicting and evaluating the bike ride patterns under different temperatures. 
- I used Python libraries, pandas, numpy, requests, json.

I have deployed the dashboard using Streamlit. The link to access the application is below:
